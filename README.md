CHIPS Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

What is Chips?
----------------

CHIPS is a digital crypto currency which is used across all the gaming platforms 
designed and developed using the pangea protocol. CHIPS is a  BTC fork with an 
apow(adoptive proof of work) integration with a block time adjusted to less than 
10 seconds to suits to the needs of the betting in real time using CHIPS. Like BTC, 
CHIPS uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing 
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. CHIPS 
Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.
